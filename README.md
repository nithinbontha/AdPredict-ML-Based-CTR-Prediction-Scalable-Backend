# AdPredict â€” ML-Based CTR Prediction & Serving

## Project Overview  
AdPredict is an end-to-end system that predicts click-through rates (CTR) for ad impressions, and serves predictions in real time.  
It includes model training, feature engineering, and a scalable backend API which handles high throughput with caching and load balancing.

## Key Features  
- Feature engineering pipeline in `utils/features.py`  
- Model training (e.g. logistic regression, XGBoost) in `model/train.py`  
- REST API prediction server using FastAPI in `service/server.py`  
- Request simulation tool in `scripts/simulate_requests.py`  
- Caching and request-level optimization (LRU cache, sharding, etc.)

## How to Run  
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
2. Prepare data under `data/sample_dataset.csv`  
3. Train model: `python model/train.py`  
4. Run service: `uvicorn service.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`  
5. Simulate load: `python scripts/simulate_requests.py`

## Tech Stack  
- Python, FastAPI  
- Scikit-learn / XGBoost  
- Redis (for caching)  
- Docker + Kubernetes (optional, for deployment)  
- DSA: LRU cache, priority queues, sharding logic

## What to Improve  
- Add logging, monitoring, rate limiting  
- Scale horizontally with autoscaling  
- Integrate feedback loop to update model in production
